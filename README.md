# Stock-Data-Tabulation
Using python to tabulate stock data from Yahoo! Finance
Hi, this is Kevin

When we want to watch our stock watchlist in Yahoo! Finance, its very disgusting when we need to put one by one our watchlist tickers. Here for you, we use Yahoo! Finance Module in python programming  in order to break your issues!
Hope you enjoy it!

Thanks!
